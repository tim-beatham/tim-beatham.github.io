        <h1>Starting the Blog Again After A Month Off</h1>

        <p>Throughout August I was working in a hotel as a full-time job and therefore I had to take a break from the blog
        for a short while. However now I am back and plan on to continue where I left off. I plan to carry on reading the book
        'Coding the Matrix'.</p>
