			<h1>About me</h1>


			<p>Welcome to my blog. I doubt anyone will ever read this other than myself but oh well. I am a first year Computer Science student
			studying at the University of St Andrews. I have decided to write a blog because frankly I am rather bored. I thought I might as well
			learn as much as possible during lockdown. Over the coming weeks I decide to learn about Computer Science topics such as Machine Learning,
			Natural Language Processing and Web servers to name a few.</p>
