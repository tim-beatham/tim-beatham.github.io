				<h1>About me</h1>


				<p >Welcome to my blog. I am a first year Computer Science student
				studying at the University of St Andrews. I have decided to write a blog because frankly I am rather bored. I thought I might as well
				learn as much as possible during lockdown. Over the coming weeks I decide to learn about Computer Science topics such as Machine Learning,
				Natural Language Processing and Web servers to name a few.</p>

				<p >I do not promise that this blog will be interesting in fact I expect it will be quite dull and boring. I plan on using it to see
				the projects that I have created over the coming months. That way it forces me to carry out a new project every week. </p>

				<p>Expect this blog to be littered with grammar misuse and spelling mistakes. English was never my strongest subject at school.</p>
