        <h1>Making Football Top Trumps In React Native and Spring Boot</h1>

        <h2>What is Top Trumps?</h2>

        <p>Top trumps is a multiplayer card game. The point of the game is to name a piece of data about the given
        card which 'trumps' other players piece of data. The person who wins that round keeps the other cards.
        The last person standing wins the game. There are differen types of top trump card packs you can buy whether it's
        Top Gear Top Trumps or Football Top Trumps. </p>

        <br />

        <p>I developed the application using React-Native as the front end and spring boot as the back end of the
        application. I developed an API so that the front end could request cards from the API. Additionally, the
        front end could add a deck to the list of decks stored in the database. </p>

        <h2>Web Scraping</h2>

        <p>To create the application I need a lot of data about different football players in different leagues. This
        was a problem as APIs do exist to retrieve data about football statistics but they require you to pay for them.
        So I instead gathered the data myself using a technique called web scrape. I developed the Web Scraping script
        in Java using JSoup which allows you to query a HTML document using regular expressions to extract key information
        from it.</p>

        <br />

        <p>
            I used the website <a href="https://www.fbref.com">FBREF</a> to extract information about the players this
            current season. Using this website I have access to most leagues in the world including leagues such as the
            Ukranian Premier League (maybe not the Scottish Premiership).

            Using this website as a template I extract information about players from the English Premier League, the
            Championship, Bundesliga and Serie A. I can add more league at any point as my script can extract information
            from any league on the site.
        </p>

        <p>Once the data is gathered I save it to a JSON file. So that I can load the data into a database. </p>

        <p>From the FBREF website I extract the following key attributes: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The number of goals the player has scored.</li>
            <li>The number of assists the player has got.</li>
            <li>The number of yellow and red cards the player has.</li>
            <li>The number of starts the player has.</li>
            <li>The number of minutes the player has played.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2></h2>

        <h2>Using a NoSQL database (MongoDB)</h2>

        <p>Once the data is gathered I need to load it into a database for the API. I decided to use a document store
        to store each player's data. I used a document store as it consists of documents which a syntactically similar to
        JSON. Additionally it is flexible as it does not require a rigid schema like that of an SQL database meaning I can
        give cards special attributes if I require. Or I can add new attributes to cards without making previous cards
        incompatible.</p>

        <p>Below is the result from a query in MongoDB:</p>

        <h2>Spring Boot</h2>

        <p>As I explained earlier I created a backend for the application in Spring Boot. Spring Boot is a Java
        framework which makes it easy to build and deploy a RESTful service in Java. In my model the client can either
        make a GET or POST request to the HTTP web server. </p>
