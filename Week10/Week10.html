# Pub Quiz Implementation Using React

The project shows my implementation of a pub quiz using React.JS, Express, MongoDB and Socket.IO.
The beauty of the quiz is that any question can be asked. It relies on one user to dedicate themselves
as a marker to mark the questions the other users have answered.

An alternative approach would be to use multiple choice questions but this does not properly simulate
a pub quiz as it gives the answer away.

There is a lot of work that needs to be done for it to be used in the real world. One would ideally want to
make it look more aestheitcally pleasing, provide a way to make a user account and add more features to the quiz
such as uploading images.

## The Main Menu

![The Main Menu](./screenshots/main_menu.png)

When making a request to the site a user is presented with a main menu. From here they can create their
own quiz, create a game or join a game.

Before creating or joining a game they are required to enter an appropriate username.

## Creating A Quiz

![Creating A Quiz](./screenshots/create_quiz.png)

When creating a quiz the user is asked to enter a series of questions and answers. They have to
provide at least one question and answer and they have to provide a title of the quiz.

From here they can then preview the quiz and consequently make a POST request to back end API. The
back end then stores the quiz in a MongoDB database.

## Creating A Game

![Creating A Game](./screenshots/create_game.png)

When creating a game the user has to select a quiz that they want to use for the game. They are presented
with all the quizzes that users have made.

## Joining A Game

![Joining A Game](./screenshots/join_game.png)

When a user joins the game they simply have to click on the game that they want to join and it takes them to
the lobby.

## The Game Lobby

The game lobby shows all of the players that are connected and it shows the quiz master in green. Only
the quiz master can press the start game button.

## Answering A Question

![Answering A Question](./screenshots/answer_question.png)

A user answers a questions by simply entering the question in the input box and pressing enter, there
is nothing fancy going on here.

## Marking A Question

![Marking A Question](./screenshots/marker.png)

The marker marks the question by selecting on a user question box. When it is green
the marker marks it as correct. When it is red the marker marks it as incorrect.

## The Leaderboard

At the end of the quiz everyone is presented with a leaderboard table which shows who won the quiz.
