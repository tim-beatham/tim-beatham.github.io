				<h1>Week 2 - Creating a Neural Network From Scratch and Evaluating The Most Important Stats In Football with Machine Learning.</h1>

				<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

				<p>Many people may have heard about machine learning in the news but many people do not understand what exactly machine learning is. Machine learning is an interdisciplinary area of Computer Science which involves Statistics, Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning algorithms are algorithms which adapt with experience. For example, given data the algorithm makes inferences about the structure of the data.
				</p>

				<p>Over the last few years Machine Learning has been massively expanding due to the advancements of computing power. In the last few years there has been a few breakthroughs in the subject one such breakthrough was Google's AlphaZero being able to play the game Go, winning 60 games and losing 40 via deep learning. Deep learning is an area of machine learning which inolves utilising Neuron Networks which I will explain later.</p>

				<p>Machine Learning can be split into two categories supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning. In this blog I will focus only on supervised machine learning as these are the algorithms I have adopted. 

				<ul>
					<li>Supervised Machine Learning - Algorithms that make use of labelled data in order to gain insight about the structure of the data. This part of machine learning can be split up further into regression and logistic algorithms. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Regression algorithms are algorithms which produces an output which is a real number.</li>
						<li>Logistic algorithms are algorithms that can only produce an output as specified by a set.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Unsupervised Machine Learning - Algorithms that take unordered, unlabelled data as input and uses techniques to gain insight into the structure of the data, such as identifying clusters.</li>
				</ul>
